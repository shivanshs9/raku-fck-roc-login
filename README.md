## No more "ROC login"s!

This tool automates logging in with your creds to skip the messy login and opened browser tabs.
Right now it reads your credentials from .env file:
```
username=<USERNAME>
password=<PASSWORD>

```

### Future Roadmap
1. Add support of existing User's profile so selenium can reuse the credentials from saved password manager.
